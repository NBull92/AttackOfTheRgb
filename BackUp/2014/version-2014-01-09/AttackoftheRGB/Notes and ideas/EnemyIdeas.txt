- green enemy boss be like th worm in gears of war, you have to destroy it a piece at a time and its head is indistructable until it's the last body part

-red enemy boss based on pic: 'redEnemyPic' shoots a constant laser out of the middle, the beam will last for about 5 seconds and then have a break of 1 sec (it's cooldown period) 
	- the range of the beam will be longer than the range of an ordianry red enemy.
	- the beam will do more damage than that of the red enemy. (double the damage)
	- when killed you unlock the beam as a new weapon to choose from
